# CFDAirfoilComparisonStudy
This project was focused on analyzing and comparing the aerodynamic characteristics of several airfoils using XFOIL and Python. I selected commonly used airfoils, such as the NACA 2412 and 4412, to evaluate their lift and drag performance across a range of angles of attack. This work was inspired by my interest in aerodynamic modeling and my previous experience simulating wing shapes for commercial aircraft.

The main objective was to determine which airfoil offered the highest lift-to-drag ratio and most favorable stall behavior under typical subsonic flight conditions. I used XFOIL to simulate the performance of each airfoil and extracted data for lift coefficient, drag coefficient, and Cl/Cd ratios. I then wrote Python scripts to visualize the data and identify trends in performance across different operating conditions.
